This module is a runnable early sketch / proof of concept for
implementing obfuscation support for OpenVPN via a new "socket
intercept" plugin type.

You can include the obfs-test plugin in the build by specifying
--enable-plugin-obfs-test at configure time.

Invoking obfs-test requires loading it via an appropriate plugin line
in the configuration file, and then specifying 'proto indirect' rather
than any other protocol. The underlying main loop is the same one used
in UDP mode, but incoming and outgoing packets will be passed through
this plugin using a very basic form of content obfuscation, and the
bind port will also be altered to demonstrate that the plugin has
control over socket creation (which will be extended to a more
sophisticated version later for supporting the desired range of
transports).

The new APIs used here are not final and do not cover every desired
use case or have completely clear semantics, but the most essential
ways in which the plugin needs to be able to interact with the core
event loop and socket code are demonstrably present.
